# Chiron

Chiron is envisioned as a web based microservices driven suite that helps train Rasa contextual AI assistants at scale. It is designed to make the lives of those who work with ai-assistants easy, by giving them a no-coding web interface to adapt , train , test and maintain such assistants .

**What is Chiron?**

Chiron is envisioned as a web based microservices driven suite that helps train contextual AI assistants at scale. It is designed to make the lives of those who work with AI-assistants easy, by giving them a no-coding web interface to adapt, train, test and maintain such assistants.
Chiron is currently built on the RASA framework.
While RASA focuses on technology of chatbots itself. Chiron on the other hand focuses on technology that deal with pre-processing of data that are needed by this framework. These include question augmentation and generation of knowledge graphs that can be used to automatically generate intents, questions and responses.
It also deals with the post processing and maintenance of these bots such metrics / follow-up messages etc. 

**What can it do?**

Chiron is open-source. 
One of the biggest problems for users is adapting contextual AI assistants to specific domain is one of the bigger problems adopting chatbots within organizations. This means extensive work creating intents by going through documentation, testing accuracy of responses, etc. Chiron‚Äôs aim is to provide a no-coding self service framework that helps users achieve this.
These are the features in the 0.1 version with many more features incoming!
-	Easy to use UI for adding ‚Äì editing Intents, Questions and Responses
-	Question augmentation to auto generate questions and enrich training data
-	Model Training and Deployment from Interface.
-	Metrics for model performance.
This website can be found at [Chiron Website] (https://chiron.digite.com/) and is hosted by Digite Inc. 

**Who uses it ?**

Chiron is built for two personas 
Teams and Individuals who want an easy no-coding interface to create, train, test and deploy chatbots. One can directly access these features from our hosted website.
Teams who want to host the chatbot trainer in-house. They can build it using docker compose. 
Our teams current focus within NLP is Knowledge Graphs ‚Äì Do let us know if you are interested. 


At this juncture it layers on top of [Rasa Open Source] (https://rasa.com/)

# Deployment
Chiron only requires a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Please do the below changes in **docker/docker-compose.yml**

1. set env variable **server** to public IP of the machine where trainer api docker container is running for example: http://localhost:8001/
    
2. set env variable **SECRET_KEY** to some random key.
    
3. use command **openssl rand -hex 32** for generating random secret key

4. run the command.
 
```shell
cd docker/
docker-compose up -d
```

5. use username: **test@demo.in** and password: **welcome@1** to try with demo user
