Steps for code documentation with Sphinx
========================================

1. Install Sphinx (pip install -U sphinx) and its RTD theme (pip install sphinx_rtd_theme).
2. Open the Command Prompt and navigate to the docs folder.
3. Run the 'sphinx-quickstart' command for creation of a new project.
4. Make the following changes in the conf.py file ->

	a. Uncomment the following code to set the parent path:
		
		import os
		import sys
		sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

	b. Change the html theme to "sphinx_rtd_theme":

		html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"
		
5. Create the individual .rst files for the various scripts to be documented, with the appropriate title and the respective Python script included in the file.

(Eg ->

Page Title
==========
.. automodule:: <Python script path>
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

)

6. Add the names of the .rst files created, in the index.rst file.
7. Once the changes are made, run the "set system_file=../system.yaml" and "set EMAIl_CONF=../email.yaml" command and then the 'make html' command to generate the html files (The html pages will be in _build\html).
8. For subsequent changes in the project, we need to first run the 'make clean' command before the 'make html' command, to effect the changes made.
